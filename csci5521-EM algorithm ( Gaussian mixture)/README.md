The required functions DoKmeans.m and GetConfusionMatrix.m are used in 'Digits problem' file. See HW3.pdf

'Picture problem' calls DoKmeans.m, too.  

'EM problem' calls DoEM.m and other necessary files.  

Also in each file, it includes main.m which calls the corresponding core function. It serves as a demo of how those function works.
