# csci5525-logistic-regression-and-naitive-gaussian
This is a course project.


The usage of the code in a terminal:

For LDA1dProjection.py and LDA2dGaussGM.py:

$ python LDA1dProjection.py <file location> <number cross>
$ python LDA2dGaussGM.py <file location> <number cross>

For logisticRegression.py and naiveBayesGaussian.py:

$ python logisticRegression.py <file location> <number of splits> <training percentages>


$ python naiveBaysGaussian.py <file location> <number of splits> <training percentages>



where [training percentages] is a comma-delimited array (no spaces!): 10,25,50,75,10



logisticRegression.py for Digits may take up to 15 minutes
